The classes implemented in this project can
1. Read input from standard console or from a file (after you uncomment the <b><em>freopen_s</em></b> and <b><em>fclose</em></b> api calls).
2. Skip corrupted test cases and move to the beginning of next test case. 
3. Produce output for each test case as long as it gets all the needed input in the order specified below.

The arguments to be supplied depends on the <em><b>test_type_code</em></b> specified in the first line of the test input. 
These <em><b>test_type_code</em></b> correspond to the examples in the link <to be defined for geeks for geeks and wikepedia>.

<blockquote>

#the first line of each test case contains test_case_id and test_type_code
#the second line of each test case contains the number of elements 'N' in the array
#the third line of each test case contains the elements of the array
#the fourth line of each test case contains the number of queries 'qn' to be executed
#the next 'qn' lines contains the queries to be executed. The format of these lines depend on test_type_code defined below
#'operation type='u' or 'q' and arguments to the operation. For example for test_type_code=1, the queries are:
#  u 2 3
#  q 2

#(test_type_code = 1) ==&gt; test point update and point query (frequency)
#(test_type_code = 2) ==&gt; test point update and point query (cumulative frequency)
#(test_type_code = 3) ==&gt; test point update and range query (frequency)
#(test_type_code = 4) ==&gt; test point update and range query (cumulative frequency)
#(test_type_code = 5) ==&gt; test range update and point query (frequency)
#(test_type_code = 6) ==&gt; test range update and point query (cumulative frequency)
#(test_type_code = 7) ==&gt; test range update and range query (frequency)
#(test_type_code = 8) ==&gt; test range update and range query (cumulative frequency)
