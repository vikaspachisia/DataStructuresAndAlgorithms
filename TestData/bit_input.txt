//the first line of each test case contains test_case_id and test_type_code
//the second line of each test case contains the number of elements 'N' in the array
//the third line of each test case contains the elements of the array
//the fourth line of each test case contains the number of queries 'qn' to be executed
//the next 'qn' lines contains the queries to be executed in the format
//'operation type='u' or 'q' and arguments to the operation. For example:
//  u 2 3
//  q 2

//(test_type_code = 1) ==> test point update and point query (frequency)
//(test_type_code = 2) ==> test point update and point query (cumulative frequency)
//(test_type_code = 3) ==> test point update and range query (frequency)
//(test_type_code = 4) ==> test point update and range query (cumulative frequency)
//(test_type_code = 5) ==> test range update and point query (frequency)
//(test_type_code = 6) ==> test range update and point query (cumulative frequency)
//(test_type_code = 7) ==> test range update and range query (frequency)
//(test_type_code = 8) ==> test range update and range query (cumulative frequency)
